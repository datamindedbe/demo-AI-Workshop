# Exercise: AI Model Comparison

Open a new Copilot Chat for each model and give each available AI model (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o1-preview) the exact same prompt:

```
Create a command-line todo list application in Python. It should let users add tasks, mark them complete, list all tasks, and save/load from a file.
```

Compare the results:
- Which model's code is cleanest and most maintainable?
- Which implementation is most complete?
- Did any model add extra features you didn't ask for?
- Which code would you actually want to use?

Bonus: Try the same prompt but ask for a "password generator" or "simple web scraper" instead.
